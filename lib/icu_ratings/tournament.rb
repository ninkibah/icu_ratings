  #
  # == Creating Tournaments
  #
  # ICU::RatedTournament objects are created directly.
  #
  #   t = ICU::RatedTournament.new
  #
  # They have some optional parameters which can be set via the constructor or by calling
  # the same-named setter methods. One is called _desc_ (short for description) the value
  # of which can be any object but will, if utilized, typically be the name of the
  # tournament as a string.
  #
  #   t = ICU::RatedTournament.new(:desc => "Irish Championships 2010")
  #   puts t.desc                         # "Irish Championships 2010"
  #
  # Another optional parameter is _start_ for the start date. A Date object or a string that can be
  # parsed as a string can be used to set it. The European convention is preferred for dates like
  # "03/06/2013" (3rd of June, not 6th of March). Attempting to set an invalid date will raise an
  # exception.
  #
  #   t = ICU::RatedTournament.new(:start => "01/07/2010")
  #   puts t.start.class                  # Date
  #   puts t.start.to_s                   # "2010-07-01"
  #
  # Also, there is the option _no_bonuses_. Bonuses are a feature of the ICU rating system. If you are
  # rating a non-ICU tournament (such as a FIDE tournament) where bonues are not awarded use this option.
  #
  #   t = ICU::RatedTournament.new(:desc => 'Linares', :start => "07/02/2009", :no_bonuses => true)
  #
  # Note, however, that the ICU system also has its own unique way of treating provisional, unrated and
  # foreign players, so the only FIDE tournaments that can be rated using this software are those that
  # consist solely of rated players.
  #
  # == Rating Tournaments
  #
  # To rate a tournament, first add the players (see ICU::RatedPlayer for details):
  #
  #   t.add_player(1, :rating => 2534, :kfactor => 16)
  #   # ...
  #
  # Then add the results (see ICU::RatedResult for details):
  #
  #   t.add_result(1, 1, 2, 'W')
  #   # ...
  #
  # Then rate the tournament by calling the <em>rate!</em> method:
  #
  #   t.rate!
  #
  # Now the results of the rating calculations can be retrieved from the players in the tournement
  # or their results. For example, player 1's new rating would be:
  #
  #   t.player(1).new_rating
  #
  # See ICU::RatedPlayer and ICU::RatedResult for more details.
  #
  # The <em>rate!</em> method takes an optional <em>version</em> argument to control the precise algorithm, for example:
  #
  #   t.rate!(version: 2)
  #
  # Without a version number or with version <em>0</em>, the original pre-2012 algorithm is used. However, some improvements
  # have since been found (see http://ratings.icu.ie/articles/18 for more details) and currently
  # the recommended version to use is <b>2</b>.
  #
  # == Error Handling
  #
  # Some of the above methods have the potential to raise RuntimeError exceptions.
  # In the case of _add_player_ and _add_result_, the use of invalid arguments would
  # cause such an error. Theoretically, the <em>rate!</em> method could also throw
  # an exception if the iterative algorithm it uses to estimate performance ratings
  # of unrated players failed to converge. However an instance of non-convergence
  # has yet to be observed in practice.
  #
  # Since exception throwing is how errors are signalled, you should arrange
  # for them to be caught and handled in some suitable place in your code.
